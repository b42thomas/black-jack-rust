# BlackJack

## Status

[![Rust](https://github.com/MRandl/BlackJack/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/MRandl/BlackJack/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This project is an implementation of the BlackJack card game in Rust.

It has minimal dependencies (apart from the Rust standard library, it only uses the *rand* crate for card shuffling).
